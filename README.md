# locallyForDevelopment
Repository with scripts that help you run deamons in userspace, locally, for development.

All these scripts have the following goals:
- No mondifications outside of the directory they are run from
- Helpfull output should be on the terminal

If you run any of these scripts, they will change files and probably even overwrite files that are there. Please read the LICENSE carfully and remember that any use is at your own risk.
